  <div class="about-content">
    <p>
      I'm an Art Director and designer with 25 years of experience spanning 
      UI/UX, branding, design systems, and print. I've led user-centered design 
      for enterprises like Patterson Dental, built design systems for NielsenIQ 
      and Optum, launched civic brands like Nice Ride Minnesota, and created 
      award-winning interactive experiences — two of which were recognized as 
      Awwwards Site of the Day.
    </p>

    <p>
      I work across the full design process: user research, information 
      architecture, visual design, and frontend development. I'm trained in 
      Human Factors International methodology and have led UX research 
      including stakeholder interviews, focus groups, persona development, 
      journey mapping, card sorting, and usability testing. I believe the 
      best interfaces come from understanding the people who use them — 
      their workflows, their frustrations, their goals.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm most effective when I can see the whole picture — from brand 
      strategy through component-level design to production code. I've 
      directed teams of up to ten, coordinated across parallel agile 
      workstreams, and built the design systems that keep complex products 
      coherent as they scale.

      Currently based in Door County, Wisconsin.
