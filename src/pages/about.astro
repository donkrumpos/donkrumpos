    <p>
      I'm an Art Director and designer with 25 years of experience spanning 
      UI/UX design, branding, design systems, and print. I've led design for 
      products ranging from enterprise software to nonprofit campaigns, always 
      grounded in user behavior and business objectives.
    </p>

    <p>
      My approach is hands-on and collaborative. I believe the best interfaces 
      come from understanding the people who use them — their workflows, their 
      frustrations, their goals. I bring that same care to brand systems and 
      print work: every design decision should earn its place.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm proficient in Figma, Adobe Creative Suite, and modern frontend 
      technologies. I've managed design systems, mentored junior designers, 
      and worked across every stage from research and wireframing through 
      final production.
    </p>

    <p>
      Based in Door County, Wisconsin. Currently open to Art Director and 
      Creative Director roles.
