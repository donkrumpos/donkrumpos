## The Challenge

Eaglesoft is Patterson Dental's flagship practice management software, used by thousands of dental offices nationwide. But the product's web presence was a basic page buried inside Patterson's corporate site — not a destination, not a sales tool, and not something a field rep could walk an office manager through with any confidence. The software was still distributed on CDs; the web needed to do the work of making it feel modern, capable, and worth the investment.

The site had to serve two audiences in sequence: sales representatives presenting the product in the field, and the office managers who'd revisit on their own afterward to evaluate the purchase. The first visit needed to impress and inform in a guided walkthrough. The return visit needed to let a decision-maker self-serve — exploring features, watching demos, and requesting a live demo when ready.

## Approach

I led design on a small in-house team, owning the project end-to-end: content strategy, information architecture, branding, visual design, and frontend development. I also conducted UX research to understand how sales reps were actually using existing materials in the field and what office managers needed to see before committing.

The information architecture was the critical piece. The previous corporate page dumped everything on one screen. I restructured the site around the sales conversation — leading with the product's core value proposition ("Power Personalized"), then branching into feature areas that mapped to how dental practices actually think about their workflows: Practice Management/Charting, Imaging, Patient Education, Training and Support.

The branding work included designing the Eaglesoft product identity within Patterson's brand ecosystem — giving the software its own visual language that felt premium and contemporary while still living under the Patterson umbrella.

## Solution

The final site centered on a rotating hero that communicated the product's key messages, with clear conversion paths to demo requests — both self-serve video demos and live demo scheduling. The navigation mapped directly to practice workflow categories, so an office manager could find their area of concern without wading through a feature list.

The bottom of the homepage served the return visit: "What's New," eServices, hardware support, and getting-started guides gave existing prospects and customers reason to come back. A partner ecosystem section (Dolphin, Schick, Sirona, CEREC) reinforced that Eaglesoft wasn't a standalone tool but part of a connected practice technology stack.

The visual design had to make practice management software — not inherently exciting — feel polished and trustworthy. Clean layout, generous whitespace, and the teal-to-white color system kept things approachable without veering into the clinical coldness that dental industry sites tend toward.

## Results

The site launched as Eaglesoft's first dedicated product platform and became the primary digital sales tool for Patterson's field representatives. It replaced a buried corporate page with a purpose-built experience that served both the guided sales presentation and the unassisted return visit — two fundamentally different use cases that the previous page couldn't address at all.
