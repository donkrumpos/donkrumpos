There's a temptation in digital design to jump straight into Figma. The tools are so good now that you can start pixel-pushing before you've really understood the problem. I've learned — sometimes the hard way — that the best interfaces start on paper.

Not wireframes, exactly. More like diagrams of relationships. What does this person need to accomplish? What information are they carrying in their head when they arrive at this screen? What's the one thing this page needs to do well?

By the time I open a design tool, the hard decisions are already made. The screen work is execution. The thinking happened at a table with a pen and a cup of coffee.
