Their existing website had grown organically over years into a sprawling, unfocused experience — part product catalog, part marketing site, part support portal — without a clear strategy for how any of their core audiences actually used it. It needed a full redesign from scratch, grounded in real user behavior rather than internal assumptions.\n\n## Approach\n\nI served as Art Director on this project, leading a team of 5-10 people across design, development, and content. Before touching a single pixel, I advocated for formal UX research training — Patterson invested in Human Factors International methodology for the team, which gave us a rigorous, science-based framework for every design decision that followed.\n\nThe research phase was comprehensive:\n\n- **Stakeholder interviews** to understand business objectives and internal constraints across Patterson's multiple divisions\n- **Focus groups with dental office managers** — the primary buyers — to understand their decision-making process, pain points with the existing site, and what they actually needed from Patterson online\n- **Focus groups with sales representatives** to understand how the site supported (or failed to support) field sales conversations\n- **Analytics review** of the existing site to identify actual usage patterns, drop-off points, and content that wasn't serving anyone\n- **Card sorting and information architecture research** to restructure the site around how users think about dental practice needs, not how Patterson's org chart was arranged\n- **Persona development** to give the team shared reference points for design decisions\n- **Journey mapping** to trace the full arc from initial research through purchase and ongoing support\n- **Usability testing on prototypes** to validate design directions before committing to development\n\nThis wasn't UX theater — every method fed directly into design decisions. The card sorting fundamentally changed the site's navigation structure. The persona work resolved internal debates about whose needs to prioritize. The usability testing caught issues that would have shipped otherwise.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe redesigned site reorganized Patterson's sprawling product and service offerings around how dental practices actually operate. The top-level navigation — Equipment & Technology, Software, Services — maps to purchasing decisions rather than internal departments.\n\nThe homepage leads with Patterson's scale (\"150,000+ Solutions and Unmatched Support\") then immediately addresses the primary user tasks: finding the right equipment, getting a software treatment plan, accessing technical service, and exploring the rewards program. Each section serves both the first-time visitor evaluating Patterson and the returning customer who needs to get something done.\n\nThe content strategy shifted from feature-dumping to benefit-oriented messaging. Rather than listing what Patterson sells, the site frames everything around practice success — \"Here to support your success,\" \"Find the right equipment for your practice,\" \"Get a software treatment plan that works for you.\" This language came directly from the focus groups: office managers didn't care about Patterson's product taxonomy, they cared about solving problems in their practice.\n\nThe partner and manufacturer ecosystem (Solventum, Dentsply Sirona, KaVo) was surfaced prominently — the research showed that brand trust in specific manufacturers was often the entry point for dental equipment purchases, and burying those relationships cost Patterson credibility.\n\n## Results\n\nThe site launched as a complete ground-up replacement of Patterson Dental's web presence, serving as the digital front door for one of the largest dental supply companies in North America.

The resulting personas weren't marketing archetypes — they were detailed profiles built from interviews and observation, documenting real workflows, pain points, goals, and the emotional texture of the work.\n\n![Persona cards for Herman (field nurse), Cynthia (member with complex conditions), Maryanne (member), and Penelope (Optum nurse on the phone)](/images/projects/optum-personas.jpg)\n\nHerman is a field nurse who spends most of his day in a car driving between home visits, using a laptop in unpredictable environments. He needs to assess a member's status quickly, update records, and move on. Cynthia is a member with multiple diagnoses who struggles to coordinate her own care across providers. Maryanne is overwhelmed by managing her condition while raising five kids and working full time. Penelope is an Optum nurse on the phone, handling back-to-back calls on a quota, trying to provide compassionate care while navigating complex clinical documentation.\n\nThese personas shaped every design decision. When we debated information density on a screen, we'd ask: \"Can Herman read this on a laptop in a dim living room?\" When we considered workflow steps: \"Does Penelope have time for this between calls?\"\n\n## Case Management Research\n\nI led research into the broader case management workflow — mapping the process from brainstorming sessions through prototyping, review, and iteration. This work documented how care teams actually coordinate, where handoffs break down, and where the tools could reduce friction.\n\n![Mural board showing case management research — process flows, brainstorming, competitive analysis, device considerations, and support metrics](/images/projects/optum-research.jpg)\n\nThe research surface included process flow mapping, competitive analysis, brainstorming outputs, device-specific considerations (mobile, desktop, Surface Hub), and support metrics that revealed where users were struggling most with existing tools.\n\n## Design System\n\nI contributed to Optum's design system, defining components that needed to work across multiple product surfaces — care plans, letters, virtual care, and administrative dashboards. The system used Optum's signature black and gold palette with a component library covering buttons at multiple sizes and states, icon buttons, controls (toggles, checkboxes, radio buttons, sliders), tags, dropdowns, and form elements.\n\n![Optum Design System — Buttons & Controls page showing component states, sizing variants, and interaction patterns](/images/projects/optum-design-system.png)\n\nHealthcare interfaces demand particular rigor in component design. Every state — default, hover, active, disabled — matters when a nurse is working quickly through a patient record. The contrast and sizing decisions had to meet accessibility standards while supporting the dense information layouts that clinical tools require.\n\n## Care Plan Product UI\n\nMy primary product ownership was the Care Plan platform. This is the tool care coordinators use to manage patient care — scheduling appointments, tracking visit history, reviewing health summaries, managing documents and medications, and coordinating across providers.\n\n![Care Plan dashboard showing provider view with upcoming appointment, patient health summary, documents, medications, and appointment timeline](/images/projects/optum-careplan-3.png)\n\nThe dashboard was designed around the provider's immediate needs: who's next, what's their status, what do I need to know before this visit starts. The health summary card, document and medication counts, and \"Start Virtual Visit\" action are all within one viewport — no scrolling to find the critical information.\n\n![Appointments view showing the daily schedule with patient details, visit reasons, document counts, and status indicators](/images/projects/optum-careplan-2.png)\n\nThe appointments list view balanced information density with scannability. Care coordinators managing a full day of patients need to see appointment times, patient names, locations, visit reasons, document status, and assignment — all in a single row without the table becoming overwhelming.\n\n## OCM Letters\n\nI also designed the OCM (Outreach Communications Management) Letters interface — the tool for managing patient correspondence including PPO notifications, denials, prior authorizations, and other compliance-driven communications.\n\n![OCM Letters interface showing patient record with letter history, delivery methods, generation status, and status indicators](/images/projects/optum-careplan-1.png)\n\nThis was a data-dense regulatory interface where clarity wasn't optional.

Their Discover platform — the primary tool analysts use to access market performance data, trend analysis, and competitive insights — needed a comprehensive redesign. The existing experience had grown fragmented as features were added over time, with inconsistent UI patterns, no unified design system, and an information architecture that didn't match how analysts actually worked.\n\nThe platform had to serve power users running complex multi-dimensional queries across product categories, geographies, and time periods — while also being approachable enough for less technical stakeholders who needed quick answers from the data.\n\n## Approach\n\nI was brought on as a contract design lead, one of several leads working across NielsenIQ's LeSS (Large-Scale Scrum) agile environment, where multiple teams shipped features in parallel against the same product surface. My primary ownership was the design system — the foundational layer that kept the product visually and structurally coherent as different teams built on top of it. Beyond the system, I contributed to the product IA, dashboard UI, guided user flows, login experience, and illustration work.\n\nCoordinating with other design leads across workstreams was a constant discipline. With parallel teams shipping simultaneously, maintaining consistency required a shared language for design decisions and regular alignment on how components were being used and extended. The design system was the connective tissue that made this possible.\n\nTo give leadership visibility into how all the pieces fit together across workstreams, I produced an end-to-end experience video that walked through the full user journey — showing how the design system, IA, guided flows, and individual screens connected into a unified product story. This became a key communication tool for stakeholders who couldn't see the forest for the sprint-level trees.\n\nThe first priority was understanding the product's complexity. NielsenIQ Discover isn't a simple dashboard — it's a multi-layered analytics platform where users construct reports across dimensions like brand, category, geography, retailer, and time period. I mapped the entire product information architecture to understand the structure before redesigning any surface.\n\n![Product IA map showing the full navigation structure and content hierarchy of NielsenIQ Discover](/images/projects/niq-ia.jpg)\n\nThat IA map became the foundation for every design decision that followed. It revealed redundancies, dead ends, and places where the navigation structure didn't match the user's mental model of how retail data analysis works.\n\n## Design System\n\nI built the design system from the ground up, establishing foundational rules that would scale across the entire platform. The system was built on a 4px increment grid — all padding, spacing, and sizing snaps to multiples of 4px (with rare 2px exceptions for optical balance at smaller breakpoints). This created mathematical consistency across every component without requiring designers to eyeball spacing.\n\n![UI Elements specification showing the 4px increment rule applied to buttons and tag components](/images/projects/niq-ui-elements.png)\n\nComponents were designed to be composable — buttons, tags, form elements, data visualization primitives — each documented with spacing specs, interaction states, and usage guidelines. The system had to support dense data interfaces without feeling cramped, which meant every pixel of padding was a deliberate decision.\n\n## Guided Flows & Product UI\n\nThe core product work centered on how analysts navigate through complex report-building workflows. I mapped and designed guided flows for the platform's key tasks — omni-channel reporting, brand shifting analysis, retail shifting, shopper performance, and geographic deep dives.\n\n![Miro board showing guided flow design for omni-channel reporting and data visualization patterns](/images/projects/niq-miro-2.jpg)\n\nEach flow had to balance flexibility with guidance. Power users needed to construct custom queries with granular control, while less experienced users needed a path that led them to meaningful insights without requiring expertise in every parameter. The solution used progressive disclosure — start with high-level choices, then expose complexity as the user narrows their focus.\n\n![Working Miro board showing the full scope of guided flows, environments, and context carry patterns](/images/projects/niq-miro-1.jpg)\n\nThe resulting dashboard UI surfaced data through a tab-based report structure — Sales Overview, Trend Share & Sales, Volume Decomposition, Performance Drivers — letting users move between analytical perspectives without losing context. The \"Context Carry\" pattern I designed ensured that filters and selections persisted as users moved between views, eliminating the frustration of re-entering parameters.\n\n![NielsenIQ Discover product UI showing the Product Performance dashboard with trend share and sales data](/images/projects/niq-discover.jpg)\n\n## Login & Brand Touch\n\nThe login screen was the user's first encounter with the platform — and an opportunity to inject brand personality into what's typically a throwaway screen. I designed the illustrated crowd pattern that fills the background, representing NIQ's tagline \"Get the Full View\" through a diverse, stylized population. The illustration was a deliberate contrast to the data-dense product behind it — a moment of warmth before the analytical work begins.\n\n![NielsenIQ login screen with illustrated crowd pattern and \"Get the Full View\" tagline](/images/projects/niq-login.jpg)\n\n## Results\n\nThe redesigned platform shipped as NielsenIQ Discover, serving as the primary analytics tool for NIQ's global client base.

The concept was built around a central character who serves as the user's proxy — a guy sitting in his living room, unaware of the danger above him. Rather than listing statistics in a brochure format, I designed an interactive narrative where the consequences unfold around this character as the user progresses through the experience.\n\nThe illustration style was a deliberate choice. A photographic approach would have made the injury scenarios disturbing. The warm, hand-drawn aesthetic kept the tone approachable and shareable while still communicating real danger — parents would send this to other parents, which was the whole point.\n\n## Solution\n\nOn desktop, the site used a horizontal scrolling mechanic powered by CSS transitions and JavaScript scroll events. The illustrated scene moved laterally around the central character, who stayed fixed in the viewport. As users scrolled through scenarios demonstrating tip-over dangers, the character accumulated visible injuries, eventually receiving a cast. Each section functioned as a distinct scene — the living room, the emergency room, the statistics — and the horizontal movement gave the experience a storybook quality that matched the illustration style.\n\n![Desktop experience showing the horizontal scroll with statistics and illustrated scenes](/images/projects/tvsafety02.jpg)\n\nThe data was woven directly into the illustrations. Impact force comparisons (a falling TV hits with 10x the force of an NFL lineman), injury statistics from the CPSC, and demographic breakdowns were presented as colorful infographic elements integrated into the scene rather than as dry callout boxes.\n\n![Interactive infographic sections with animated data visualization](/images/projects/tvsafety03.jpg)\n\nFor mobile, the horizontal scroll was restructured into a vertical infographic. The same illustrations, data, and narrative flow were preserved, but recomposed for single-column reading. This wasn't a scaled-down desktop — it was a considered redesign of the interaction model for how people actually use phones.\n\nClear calls to action — Learn, Take Action, Share, About — anchored the bottom of the viewport on desktop and served as the primary navigation, driving users toward the pledge mechanic and social sharing.\n\n## Results\n\nThe site was recognized as an **Awwwards Site of the Day** and accumulated over 3,900 Facebook likes — strong engagement for a corporate safety PSA. The illustrated approach proved that even compliance-driven content can be engaging when the design serves the audience rather than the brief. The visual language extended into Sanus's broader safety communications and the site served as their primary consumer safety resource.","src/content/projects/tv-safety.md","575e4b3ac5a9ac14",{"html":252,"metadata":253},"\u003Ch2 id=\"the-challenge\">The Challenge\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Flat-panel TVs tipping over causes thousands of injuries each year, disproportionately affecting young children.
